# Leetcode
Solutions that I have used to solve problems on Leetcode. Some problems clearly struggled with more, each with my code notes for each problem.

The majority of my solutions are in python as it is the language that I find the most convenient when completing these problems, however I may go back and complete the problems I have done so far in other languages such as either Java or C#. Most likely in C# as that is the next language that I wish to learn!
